Description: Tidy and plot meta-analyses from popular meta-analytic tools in R.
    Currently supports `metafor`. `tidymeta` makes it easy to work with 
    meta-analyses in a tidy and consistent manner. In addition to working with 
    results, `tidymeta` also includes `ggplot2` geoms and common data 
    visualizations for meta-analyses, such as forest plots, funnel plots, 
    and influence plots.
